Python's iterable and iterator library for JavaScript.
Parent is [js-library](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-library).

> :warning: Depending on your environment, the code may require
> `regeneratorRuntime` to be defined, for instance by importing
> [regenerator-runtime/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime).

```js
import {cycle} from '@iterable-iterator/cycle';
import {chain} from '@iterable-iterator/chain';
cycle( chain( [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) ) ; // 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 ...
```

## :newspaper: Description

The goal of this project is to make (the parts that interest me of)
the following python constructs/idioms/libraries available in JavaScript under the
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-itertools.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-itertools/main/LICENSE)
  - `iter`, `next`, `StopIteration`, `list`, `sorted`, `map`, `zip`, `filter`, `sum`, `any`, `all`, `min`, `max`
  - [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
  - [itertools recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes)
  - [more-itertools](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools)
  - [cardinality](https://github.com/wbolster/cardinality)
  - [`reduce`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html?highlight=reduce#functools.reduce)

The corresponding software library used to be released as a monolith.
It has since been split up into multiple packages.

## :deciduous_tree: Hierarchy

The packages are released under multiple npm @scopes.
Extra features are marked with a `*`.
